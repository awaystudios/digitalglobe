Key changes are:

Loading JSON files
_app/data/countries.json
_app/data/vendors.json

I'm now passing the globe: handsetChange() & globe: viewChange() the index value of the item in the JSON file.
("Global View" is -1)
Let me know if this is correct or if you want a text label?

JSON data is populating the dropdowns

Timeline scrubber is now up & running (inc for touch devices) and streaming values (0.0 to 1.0) on mouseMove.
Again let me know if you want a different range of values, and if you just want the change event from the scrubber to happen onRelease (rather than constant). 

Loading of assets on screen is better managed, so no little loading jerks.

The app is outputting lot's of console.log... if you want to switch that off then in index.html, change the "debug" param:
App.init(true, "_app/data/"); 

to

App.init(false, "_app/data/");
